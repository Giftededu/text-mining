## 1. PREPARE

The transition to digital learning has made available new sources of data, providing researchers new opportunities for understanding and improving STEM learning. Data sources such as digital learning environments and administrative data systems, as well as data produced by social media websites and the mass digitization of academic and practitioner publications, hold enormous potential to address a range of pressing problems in STEM Education, but collecting and analyzing text-based data also presents unique challenges.

**Text Mining (TM) Module 1: Public Sentiment and the State Standards** will help demonstrate how text mining can be applied in STEM education research and provide LASER Institute scholars hands-on experience with popular techniques for collecting, processing, and analyzing text-based data. Specifically, the four learning labs that make up this module address the following topics:

-   **Learning Lab 1: Tidy Text, Tokens, & Twitter.** We take a closer look at the literature and research questions that will be guiding our analysis; importing data through Twitter's developer API; and wrangling our data into a one-token-per-row tidy text format.

-   **Learning Lab 2: Word Counts, Clouds & Correlations.** For our second lab, we use simple summary statistics, data visualization, and word correlations to explore our data and see what insight they provides in response to our questions.

-   **Learning Lab 3: Sentiment Analysis & School Reform.** We focus on the use of lexicons to compare the sentiment of tweets about the NGSS and CCSS state standards in order to better understand public reaction to these two curriculum reform efforts. 

-   **Learning Lab 4: A Tale of Two Standards.** We wrap our look at public sentiment around STEM state curriculum standards by selecting an analysis that provides some unique insight; refining or polishing a data product, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form; and writing a brief narrative explaining the ways in which the data product helps answer the research question.

### 1a. Review the Literature

Text Mining Module 1 is guided by a recent publication by @rosenberg2020, *Advancing new methods for understanding public sentiment about educational reforms: The case of Twitter and the Next Generation Science Standards*. This study in turn builds on upon previous work by @wang2017 examining public opinion on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) on Twitter. For Module 1, we will focus on analyzing tweets about the [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org) (NGSS) and [Common Core State Standards](http://www.corestandards.org) (CCSS) in order to better understand key words and phrases that emerge, as well as public sentiment towards these two curriculum reform efforts.

#### Twitter and the Next Generation Science Standards

![](img/rosenberg.png){width="30%"}

[Full Paper (Preprint)](https://osf.io/xymsd/.)

**Abstract**

While the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are a long-standing and widespread standards-based educational reform effort, they have received less public attention, and no studies have explored the sentiment of the views of multiple stakeholders toward them. To establish how public sentiment about this reform might be similar to or different from past efforts, we applied a suite of data science techniques to posts about the standards on Twitter from 2010-2020 (N = 571,378) from 87,719 users. Applying data science techniques to identify teachers and to estimate tweet sentiment, we found that the public sentiment towards the NGSS is overwhelmingly positive -- 33 times more so than for the CCSS. Mixed effects models indicated that sentiment became more positive over time and that teachers, in particular, showed a more positive sentiment towards the NGSS. We discuss implications for educational reform efforts and the use of data science methods for understanding their implementation.

**Data Source & Analysis**

Similar to what we'll be learning in this lab, Rosenberg et al. used publicly accessible data from Twitter collected using the Full-Archive Twitter API and the `rtweet` package in R. Specifically, the authors accessed tweets and user information from the hashtag-based \#NGSSchat online community, all tweets that included any of the following phrases, with "/" indicating an additional phrase featuring the respective plural form: "ngss", "next generation science standard/s", "next gen science standard/s".

Unlike this learning lab, however, the authors determined Tweet sentiment using the Java version of SentiStrength to assign tweets to two 5-point scales of sentiment, one for positivity and one for negativity, because SentiStrength is a validated measure for sentiment in short informal texts (Thelwall et al., 2011). In addition, they used this tool because Wang and Fikis (2019) used it to explore the sentiment of CCSS-related posts. We'll be using the AFINN sentiment lexicon which also assigns words in a tweet to two 5-point scales, in addition to exploring some other sentiment lexicons to see if they produce similar results.

The authors also used the `lme4` package in R to run a mixed effects model to determine if sentiment changes over time and differs between teachers and non-teacher. In addition to looking at the relationships between tweet sentiment, time and teachers, we'll also take a look at the correlation between words within tweets.

**Summary of Key Findings**

1.  Contrasting with sentiment about CSSS, sentiment about the NGSS science education reform effort is overwhelmingly positive, with approximately 9 positive tweets for every negative tweet.
2.  Teachers were more positive than non-teachers, and sentiment became substantially more positive over the ten years of NGSS-related posts.
3.  Differences between the context of the tweets were small, but those that did not include the \#NGSSchat hashtag became more positive over time than those posts that did not include the hashtag.
4.  Individuals posted more tweets during \#NGSSchat chats, the sentiment of their posts was more positive, suggesting that while the context of individual tweets has a small effect (with posts not including the hashtag becoming more positive over time), the effect upon individuals of being involved in the \#NGSSchat was positive.

Finally, you can watch Dr. Rosenberg provide a quick 3-minute overview of this work at [\<https://stanford.app.box.com/s/i5ixkj2b8dyy8q5j9o5ww4nafznb497x\>](https://stanford.app.box.com/s/i5ixkj2b8dyy8q5j9o5ww4nafznb497x){.uri}

### 1b. Define Questions

One overarching question that Silge and Robinson (2018) identify as a central question to text mining and natural language processing, and that we'll explore throughout the text mining labs this year, is the question:

> How do we to **quantify** what a document or collection of documents is about?

The questions guiding the Rosenberg et al. study attempt to quantify public sentiment around the NGSS and how that sentiment changes over time. Specifically, they asked:

1.  What is the public sentiment expressed toward the NGSS?
2.  How does sentiment for teachers differ from non-teachers?
3.  How do tweets posted to \#NGSSchat differ from those without the hashtag?
4.  How does participation in \#NGSSchat relate to the public sentiment individuals express?
5.  How does public sentiment vary over time?

For our first lab on text mining in STEM education, we'll use approaches similar to those used by the authors cited above to better understand public discourse surrounding these standards, particularly as they relate to STEM education. We will also try to guage public sentiment around the NGSS, by comparing how much more positive or negative NGSS tweets are relative to CSSS tweets. Specifically, in the next four learning lab we'll attempt to answer the following questions:

1.  What are the most frequent words or phrases used in reference to tweets about the CCSS and NGSS?
2.  What words and hashtags commonly occur together?
3.  How does sentiment for NGSS compare to sentiment for CCSS?

### 1c. Prepare Environment

#### Load Packages

Let's begin by loading some familiar packages from previous Learning Labs that we'll be using for data wrangling and exploration:

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library (DT)
```

#### rtweet 📦

![](img/rtweet.jpeg){width="100"}

The `rtweet` package provides users a range of functions designed to extract data from Twitter's REST and streaming APIs and has three main goals:

1.  Formulate and send requests to Twitter's REST and stream APIs.

2.  Retrieve and iterate over returned data.

3.  Wrangling data into tidy structures.

Let's load the `rtweet` package which we'll be using later in this lab to accomplish all three of the goals listed above:

```{r load-rtweet, message=FALSE}
library(rtweet)
```

#### Authorize RStudio

In order to authorize R to use your Twitter App to retrieve data, you'll need to create a personal Twitter token by completing the following steps:

1.  Navigate to [developer.twitter.com/en/apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and select your Twitter app
2.  Click the tab labeled `Keys and tokens` to retrieve your keys.
3.  Locate the `Consumer API keys` (aka "API Secret").

![](img/create-app-6.png){width="80%"}

3.  Scroll down to `Access token & access token secret` and click `Create`

![](img/create-app-7.png){width="80%"}

4.  Copy and paste the four keys (along with the name of your app) into an `twitter-auth.R` file located in your directory and pass them along to `create_token()`. Note, these keys are named secret for a reason. We store these up in a separate R script file rather than in a file you will eventually share.

```{r api-keys, eval=FALSE}
## store api keys (these are fake example values; replace with your own keys)
app_name <- "Text Mining in Education"
api_key <- "afYS4vbIlPAj096E60c4W1fiK"
api_secret_key <- "bI91kqnqFoNCrZFbsjAWHD4gJ91LQAhdCJXCj3yscfuULtNkuu"
access_token <- "9551451262-wK2EmA942kxZYIwa5LMKZoQA4Xc2uyIiEwu2YXL"
access_token_secret <- "9vpiSGKg1fIPQtxc5d5ESiFlZQpfbknEN1f1m2xe5byw7"

## authenticate via web browser
token <- create_token(
  app = app_name,
  consumer_key = api_key,
  consumer_secret = api_secret_key,
  access_token = access_token,
  access_secret = access_token_secret)
```

#### Check Authorization

The `create_token()` function should automatically save your token as an environment variable for you. So next time you start an R session [on the same machine], rtweet should automatically find your token.

10. To make sure it works, you can run the following code and check to make sure the app name and `api_key` match.

```{r get-token}
## check to see if the token is loaded
get_token()
```

That's it! We're ready to start wrangling some tweets!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. WRANGLE

In general, data wrangling involves some combination of cleaning, reshaping, transforming, and merging data (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017). The importance of data wrangling, particularly when working with text as data, is difficult to overstate, as it involves the initial steps of going from raw data to a dataset that can be explored and modeled (Krumm et al, 2018).

a.  **Search Tweets**. In this section, we introduce new functions from the `rtweet` package to search for and filter tweets and users of interest.
b.  **Tidy Text**. We also introduce the `tidytext` package to both "tidy" and tokenize our tweets in order to create our data frame for analysis.
c.  **Stop Words.** We conclude our data wrangling by using the now familiar `dplyr` package to remove words that don't add much value to our analysis.

### 2a. Search Tweets

#### Constructing a Query

Since one of our goals for this Learning Lab is a simplistic replication of the study by Rosenberg et al. (2021), let's begin by introducing the `search_tweets()` function to mine some tweets about the Next Generation Science Standards.

In your guided practice file, run the following code for requesting from Twitter's API 5,000 tweets containing the NGSS hashtag and store as a new data frame `ngss_tweets_q1`:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_q1 <- search_tweets(q = "#NGSSchat", 
                                n = 5000)
```

Note that the first argument `q =` that the `search_tweets()` function expects is the search term included in quotation marks and that `n =` specifies the maximum number of tweets

#### [Your Turn]{style="color: green;"} ⤵ {style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"}

Use the code chunk below to view your new `ngss_tweets_q1` data frame using one of the methods previously introduced to help answer the following questions:

```{r}

```

1.  How many tweets did our query using the Twitter API actually return? How many variables?
2.  
3.  Why do you think our query pulled in far less than 5,000 tweets requested? [Hint](https://cbail.github.io/textasdata/apis/rmarkdown/Application_Programming_interfaces.html#rate-limiting).
4.  How many tweets are returned if you don't include the `n =` argument?
5.  Does our query also include retweets? How do you know?
6.  Does capitalization in your query matter?

#### Using the OR Operator

If you recall from the previous section, the authors accessed tweets and user information from the hashtag-based \#NGSSchat online community, and all tweets that included any of the following phrases: "ngss", "next generation science standard/s", "next gen science standard/s". Note that "/" indicates an additional phrase featuring the respective plural form

Let's modify our query using the `OR` operator to also include "ngss" so it will return tweets containing either \#NGSSchat or "ngss" and assign to `ngss_or_tweets`:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_q2 <- search_tweets(q = "#NGSSchat OR ngss", 
                                n = 5000)

head(ngss_tweets_q2)
```

#### [Your Turn]{style="color: green;"} ⤵

Try including both search terms but excluding the `OR` operator to answer the following question:

1.  Does excluding the `OR` operator return more tweets, the same number of tweets, or fewer tweets? Why?
2.  Does our query also include tweets containing the \#ngss hashtag?
3.  What other useful arguments does the `search_tweet()` function contain? Try adding one and see what happens.

Hint: Use the `?search_tweets` help function to learn more about the `q` argument and other arguments for composing search queries.

#### Using Multiple Queries

Unfortunately, the `OR` operator will only get us so far. In order to include the additional search terms, we will need to use the `c()` function to combine our search terms into a single list.

The `rtweets` package has an additional `search_tweets2()` function for using multiple queries in a search. To do this, either wrap single quotes around a search query using double quotes, e.g., `q = '"next gen science standard"'` or escape each internal double quote with a single backslash, e.g., `q = "\"next gen science standard\""`.

Copy and past the following code to store the results of our query in `ngss_tweets`:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_q3 <- search_tweets2(q = c("#NGSSchat OR ngss",
                                       '"next generation science standard"'),
                                 n = 5000)
```

Notice the unique syntax required for the query argument. For example, when "OR" is entered between search terms, `query = "#NGSSchat OR ngss"`, Twitter's REST API should return any tweet that contains either "\#NGSSchat" or "ngss." It is also possible to search for exact phrases using double quotes. To do this, either wrap single quotes around a search query using double quotes, e.g., `q = '"next generation science standard"'` as we did above, or escape each internal double quote with a single backslash, e.g., `q = "\"next generation science standard\""`.

#### Our First Dictionary

We still have a few queries to add in order to replicate the approach by Rosenberg et al, but dealing with that many queries inside a single function is a bit tedious. Let's go ahead and create our very first "dictionary" --- we'll learn more about dictionary-based approaches in Part 3 --- for identifying tweets related to the NGSS standards, and then pass that dictionary to the `q =` query argument to pull related tweets:

To do so, we'll need to add some additional search terms to our list. Run the following code to store your dictionary and queried tweets in your environment:

```{r}
ngss_dictionary <- c("#NGSSchat OR ngss",
                     '"next generation science standard"',
                     '"next generation science standards"',
                     '"next gen science standard"',
                     '"next gen science standards"')

ngss_tweets_q4 <- search_tweets2(ngss_dictionary,
                              n=5000)
```

#### [Your Turn]{style="color: green;"} ⤵

1.  In your practice Rmd file, write a new query based on a STEM area of interest.

2.  Assign your search to a new object called `my_tweets` or something appropriate.

3.  Output your new dataset using the `datatable()` function from the `DT` package and take a quick look.

To learn more about constructing search terms using the query argument, enter `?search_tweets` in your console and review the documentation for the `q=` argument.

#### Other Useful Functions (Optional)

For your own research, you may be interested in exploring posts by specific users rather than topics, key words, or hashtags. Yes, there is a function for that too!

For example, let's create another list containing the usernames of the LASER Institute leads using the `c()` function again and use the `get_timelines()` function to get the most recent tweets from each of those users:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
laser_peeps <- c("sbkellogg", "jrosenberg6432", "yanecnu", "robmoore3", "hollylynnester")

laser_tweets <- laser_peeps %>%
  get_timelines(include_rts=FALSE)
```

Notice that you can use the pipe operator with the `rtweet` functions just like you would other functions from the tidyverse.

And let's use the `sample_n()` function from the `dplyr` package to pick 10 random tweets and use `select()` to select and view just the `screenname` and `text` columns that contains the user and the content of their post:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
sample_n(laser_tweets, 10) %>%
  select(screen_name, text)
```

The `rtweet` package also has handy `ts_plot` function built into `rtweet` to take a very quick look at how far back our data set goes:

```{r ts_plot, eval=TRUE}
ts_plot(ngss_tweets_q4, by = "days")
```

Notice that this effectively creates a `ggplot` time series plot for us. I've included the `by =` argument which by default is set to "days". It looks like tweets go back 9 days which is the rate limit set by Twitter.

Try changing it to "hours" and see what happens.

#### [Your Turn]{style="color: green;"} ⤵ {style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"}

To conclude Section 2a, try one of the following search functions from the `rtweet` vignette:

1.  `get_timelines()` Get the most recent 3,200 tweets from users.
2.  `stream_tweets()` Randomly sample (approximately 1%) from the live stream of all tweets.
3.  `get_friends()` Retrieve a list of all the accounts a user follows.
4.  `get_followers()` Retrieve a list of the accounts following a user.
5.  `get_favorites()` Get the most recently favorited statuses by a user.
6.  `get_trends()` Discover what's currently trending in a city.
7.  `search_users()` Search for 1,000 users with the specific hashtag in their profile bios.

We've only scratched the surface of the number of functions available in the `rtweets` package for searching Twitter. To learn more about the `rtweet` package, you can find full documentation on CRAN at: [\<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/rtweet.pdf\>](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/rtweet.pdf){.uri}

Or use the following function to access the package vignette:

```{r rtweet-vignette, eval=F}
vignette("intro", package="rtweet")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2b. Restructure Data

#### Subset Tweets

As you may have noticed, we have way more data than we need for our analysis and should probably pare it down to just what we'll use.

First, it's likely the authors removed retweets from their analysis since a retweet is simply a user reposting someone else's tweet and would duplicate the exact same content of the original.

It's also likely that they limited their analysis to just English language tweets so let's filter for those as well.

Use the `filter()` function introduced in previous labs to subset rows containing only original tweets in the English language:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
ngss_tweets_r1 <- ngss_tweets_q4 %>% filter(is_retweet == "FALSE", 
                                            lang == "en")
```

Now let's use the `select()` function to select the following columns from our new `ngss_teeets_en` data frame:

1.  `screen_name` of the user who created the tweet
2.  `created_at` timestamp for examining changes in sentiment over time
3.  `text` containing the tweet which is our primary data source of interest

```{r select-variables, eval=TRUE}
ngss_tweets_r2 <- select(ngss_tweets_r1,
                      screen_name, 
                      created_at, 
                      text)
```

#### Add & Reorder Columns

Finally, since we are interested in comparing the sentiment of NGSS tweets with CSSS tweets, it would be helpful if we had a column to quickly identify the set of state standards with which each tweet is associated.

We'll use the `mutate()` function to create a new variable called `standards` to label each tweets as "ngss":

```{r}
ngss_tweets_r3 <- mutate(ngss_tweets_r2, standards = "ngss")
```

And just because it bothers me, I'm going to use the `relocate()` function to move the `standards` column to the first position so I can quickly see which standards the tweet is from:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_r4 <- relocate(ngss_tweets_r3, standards)
```

Note that you could also have used the `select()` function to reorder columns like so:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_r5 <- select(ngss_tweets_r4, standards, screen_name, created_at, text)
```

Before moving on to the CCSS standards, let's rewrite the code from our wrangling so there is less redundancy and it is easier to read:

```{r}
# Search Tweets
ngss_dictionary <- c("#NGSSchat OR ngss",
                     '"next generation science standard"',
                     '"next generation science standards"',
                     '"next gen science standard"',
                     '"next gen science standards"')

ngss_tweets <- ngss_dictionary %>%
  search_tweets2(n = 5000,
                 include_rts = FALSE,
                 lang = "en") %>%
  select(text, screen_name, created_at) %>%
  mutate(standards = "ngss") %>%
  relocate(standards)

head(ngss_tweets)
```

**Note:** Rather than using `filter()` to remove retweets and non-English language tweets, we used the handy `include_rts = FALSE` and `lang = "en"` arguments included in the `search_tweets2()` function to simplify the code.

##### [Your Turn]{style="color: green;"} ⤵

Recall from section [1b. Define Questions] that we are interested in comparing word usage and public sentiment around both the Common Core and Next Gen Science Standards.

1.  Create an new `ccss_tweets` data frame consisting of Common Core tweets by modifying code above.

2.  Similar to Wang and Fikis (2019), use the \#CommonCore and \#CCSS hashtags as your search terms.

3.  Try using the handy `include_rts = FALSE` and `lang = "en"` arguments included in the `search_tweets2()` function to remove retweets and non-English language tweets.

You're output should look something like this:

```{r retweet-argument, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ccss_tweets <- search_tweets(q = "#commoncore OR #ccss", 
                             n=5000, 
                             include_rts = FALSE,
                             lang = "en") %>%
  select(text, screen_name, created_at) %>%
  mutate(standards = "ccss") %>%
  relocate(standards)
  

datatable(ccss_tweets)
```

[**WARNING:**]{style="color: red;"} You will not be able to progress to the next section until you have completed the following task:

#### Merge Data Frames

Finally, let's combine our `ccss_text` and `ngss_text` into a single data frame by using the `bind_rows()` function from `dplyr` by simply supplying the data frames that you want to combine as arguments:

```{r}
ss_tweets <- bind_rows(ngss_tweets, ccss_tweets)
```

Note that when creating a "union" like this (i.e. stacking one data frame on top of another), you should have the same number of columns in each data frame and they should be in the exact same order.

And let's take a quick look at both the `head()` and the `tail()` of this new `tweets` data frame to make sure it contains both "ngss" and "ccss" standards:

```{r}
head(ss_tweets)
tail(ss_tweets)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2c. Tidy Text

Text data, by it's very nature is ESPECIALLY untidy and sometimes referred to as "unstructured." In this section we are introduced to the `tidytext` package and will learn some new functions to convert text to and from tidy formats. Having our text in a tidy format will allow us to switch seamlessly between tidy tools and existing text mining packages, while also making it easier to visualize text summaries in other data analysis tools like Tableau.

For a more comprehensive introduction to the `tidytext` package, we cannot recommend enough the free online book, [Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach](https://www.tidytextmining.com) by Silge and Robinson (2018).

#### tidytext 📦

![](img/tidytext.png){width="100"}

As we'll learn first hand in this lab, using tidy data principles can make many text mining tasks easier, more effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use. Much of the infrastructure needed for text mining with tidy data frames already exists in `tidyverse` packages with which we've already been introduced.

Let's go ahead and load `tidytext`:

```{r load-tidytext, message=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
```

#### Tokenize Text {data-link="2b. Tidy Text"}

In [Chapter 1 of Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html), Silge and Robinson (2018) define the tidy text format as a table with one-token-per-row, and explain that:

> A **token** is a meaningful unit of text, such as a word, two-word phrase (bigram), or sentence that we are interested in using for analysis. And tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens.

This one-token-per-row structure is in contrast to the ways text is often stored for text analysis, perhaps as strings in a corpus object or in a document-term matrix. For tidy text mining, the token that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or paragraph.

For this part of our workflow, our goal is to transform our `ss_tweets` data from this:

```{r ccss-table, echo=FALSE}
ss_tweets
```

Into a "tidy text" one-token-per-row format that looks like this:

```{r tweet-tidy, echo=FALSE}
tidy_tweets <- ss_tweets %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, 
                input = text, 
                token = "tweets") %>% 
  relocate(standards, word)

```

```{r ccss-tibble, echo=FALSE}
tidy_tweets
```

In later labs we'll learn about other data structures for text analysis like the document-term matrix and corpus objects. For now, however, working with the familiar tidy data frame allows us to take advantage of popular packages that use the shared tidyverse syntax and principles for wrangling, exploring, and modeling data.

##### Unigrams

The `tidytext` package provides the incredibly powerful `unnest_tokens()` function to tokenize text (including tweets!) and convert them to a one-token-per-row format.

Let's tokenize our tweets by using this function to split each tweet into a single row to make it easier to analyze:

```{r unnest-tokens}
ss_tweets_u1 <- unnest_tokens(ss_tweets, 
                               output = word, 
                               input = text)

head(ss_tweets_u1)
```

There is A LOT to unpack with this function:

-   First notice that `unnest_tokens()` expects a data frame as the first argument, followed by two column names.
-   The second argument is an output column name that doesn't currently exist but will be created as the text is "unnested" into it (`word`, in this case).
-   This is followed by the input column that the text comes from, which we uncreatively named `text`.
-   By default, a token is an individual word or unigram.
-   Other columns, such as `screen_name` and `created_at`, are retained.
-   All punctuation has been removed.
-   Tokens have been changed to lowercase, which makes them easier to compare or combine with other datasets (use the `to_lower = FALSE` argument to turn off if desired).

The `unnest_tokens()` function also has specialized `“tweets”` tokenizer in the `tokens =` argument that is very useful for dealing with Twitter text in that it retains hashtags and mentions of usernames with the \@ symbol.

Rewrite the code below to include the token argument set to "tweets":

```{r token-tweet, eval=FALSE}
ss_tweets_u2 <- unnest_tokens(ss_tweets, 
                              output = word, 
                              input = text, 
                              _____ = _____)
```

Your output should look something like this:

```{r ccss-unigram, echo=FALSE}
ss_tweets_u2 <- unnest_tokens(ss_tweets, 
                             output = word, 
                             input = text, 
                             token = "tweets")

head(ss_tweets_u2)
```

##### Bigrams

In the function above we specified tokens as individual words, but many interesting text analyses are based on the relationships between words, which words tend to follow others immediately, or words that tend to co-occur within the same documents.

We can also use the `unnest_tokens()` function to tokenize our tweets into consecutive sequences of words, called **n-grams**. By seeing how often word X is followed by word Y, we can then build a model of the relationships between them as well see in Part 2.

We do this by adding the `token = "ngrams"` option to [`unnest_tokens()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/tidytext/man/unnest_tokens.html), and setting `n` to the number of words in each n-gram. Let's set `n` to 2, so we can examine pairs of two consecutive words, often called "bigrams":

```{r ccss-bigrams}
ss_tweets_b1 <- ss_tweets %>% 
  unnest_tokens(bigram, 
                text, 
                token = "ngrams", 
                n = 2)

head(ss_tweets_b1)
```

Before we move any further let's take a quick look at the most common unigrams and bigrams in our two datasets:

```{r}
ss_tweets_u2 %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

ss_tweets_b1 %>% 
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

Well, many of these tweets are clearly about the ccss and ngss, but beyond that it's a bit hard to tell because there are so many "stop words" like "the", "to", "and", "in" that don't carry much meaning by themselves.

#### Remove Stop Words

Often in text analysis, we will want to remove these stop words if they are not useful for an analysis. The `stop_words` dataset in the tidytext package contains stop words from three lexicons. We can use them all together, as we have here, or `filter()` to only use one set of stop words if that is more appropriate for a certain analysis.

Let's take a closer the lexicons and stop words included in each:

```{r}
datatable(stop_words)
```

#### The `anti_join` Function

In order to remove these stop words, we will use a function called `anti_join()` that looks for matching values in a specific column from two datasets and returns rows from the original dataset that have no matches like so:

![](img/anti-join.png)

For a good overview of the different `dplyr` joins see here: <https://medium.com/the-codehub/beginners-guide-to-using-joins-in-r-682fc9b1f119>

Now let's remove stop words that don't help us learn much about what people are saying about the state standards.

```{r stop-unigrams}
ss_tweets_u3 <- anti_join(ss_tweets_u2,
                           stop_words,
                           by = "word")

head(ss_tweets_u3)
```

Notice that we've specified the `by =` argument to look for matching words in the `word` column for both data sets and remove any rows from the `tweet_tokens` dataset that match the `stop_words` dataset. Remember when we first tokenized our dataset I conveniently chose `output = word` as the column name because it matches the column name `word` in the `stop_words` dataset contained in the `tidytext` package. This makes our call to `anti_join()`simpler because `anti_join()` knows to look for the column named `word` in each dataset. However this wasn't really necessary since `word` is the only matching column name in both datasets and it would have matched those columns by default.

#### Filtering Bigrams

As we saw above, a lot of the most common bigrams are pairs of common (uninteresting) words as well. Dealing with these is a little less straightforward and we'll need to use the `separate()` function from the `tidyr` package, which splits a column into multiple based on a delimiter. This lets us separate it into two columns, "word1" and "word2", at which point we can remove cases where either is a stop-word.

```{r stop-bigrams}
library(tidyr)

ss_tweets_b2 <- ss_tweets_b1 %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")

ss_tweets_b3 <- ss_tweets_b2 %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

ss_tweets_b4 <- ss_tweets_b3 %>%
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")
```

\

#### Custom Stop Words

Before wrapping up, let's take a quick count of the most common unigrams and bigrams to see if the results are a little more meaningful:

```{r}
ss_tweets_u3 %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

ss_tweets_b4 %>% 
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

Notice that the nonsense word "amp" is among our high frequency words. Let's add a filter to our previous code similar to what we did with our bigrams to remove rows with "amp" in them:

```{r}
ss_tweets_u4 <-
  ss_tweets_u3 %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  filter(!word == "amp")
```

Note that we could extend this filter to weed out any additional words that don't carry much meaning but skew our data by being so prominent.

Tidy your `my_tweets` dataset from Section 2a by tokenizing your text into unigrams and removing stop words.

Also, since we created some unnecessarily lengthy code to demonstrate many of the steps in the tidying process, try to use a more compact series of functions and assign your data frame to `my_tidy_tweets`.
