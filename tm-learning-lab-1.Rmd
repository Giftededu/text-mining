## 1. PREPARE

The transition to digital learning has made available new sources of data, providing researchers new opportunities for understanding and improving STEM learning. Data sources such as digital learning environments and administrative data systems, as well as data produced by social media websites and the mass digitization of academic and practitioner publications, hold enormous potential to address a range of pressing problems in STEM Education, but collecting and analyzing text-based data also presents unique challenges.

**Text Mining (TM) Module 1: Public Sentiment and the State Standards** will help demonstrate how text mining can be applied in STEM education research and provide LASER Institute scholars hands-on experience with popular techniques for collecting, processing, and analyzing text-based data. Specifically, the four learning labs that make up this module address the following topics:

-   **Learning Lab 1: Tidy Text, Tokens, & Twitter.** We take a closer look at the literature and research questions that will be guiding our analysis; importing data through Twitter's developer API; and wrangling our data into a one-token-per-row tidy text format.

-   **Learning Lab 2: Word Counts, Clouds & Correlations.** For our second lab, we use simple summary statistics, data visualization, and word correlations to explore our data and see what insight they provides in response to our questions.

-   **Learning Lab 3: Come to the Dark Side.** We focus on the use of lexicons and introduce the {vader} package to compare the sentiment of tweets about the NGSS and CCSS state standards in order to better understand public reaction to these two curriculum reform efforts. 

-   **Learning Lab 4: A Tale of Two Standards.** We wrap our look at public sentiment around STEM state curriculum standards by selecting an analysis that provides some unique insight; refining and polishing a data product; and writing a brief narrative to communicate findings in response to our research questions.

### 1a. Review the Literature

Text Mining Module 1 is guided by a recent publication by @rosenberg2020, *Advancing new methods for understanding public sentiment about educational reforms: The case of Twitter and the Next Generation Science Standards*. This study in turn builds on upon previous work by @wang2017 examining public opinion on the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) on Twitter. For Module 1, we will focus on analyzing tweets about the [Next Generation Science Standards](https://www.nextgenscience.org) (NGSS) and [Common Core State Standards](http://www.corestandards.org) (CCSS) in order to better understand key words and phrases that emerge, as well as public sentiment towards these two curriculum reform efforts.

#### Twitter and the Next Generation Science Standards

![](img/rosenberg.png){width="30%"}

[Full Paper (Preprint)](https://osf.io/xymsd/.)

**Abstract**

While the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are a long-standing and widespread standards-based educational reform effort, they have received less public attention, and no studies have explored the sentiment of the views of multiple stakeholders toward them. To establish how public sentiment about this reform might be similar to or different from past efforts, we applied a suite of data science techniques to posts about the standards on Twitter from 2010-2020 (N = 571,378) from 87,719 users. Applying data science techniques to identify teachers and to estimate tweet sentiment, we found that the public sentiment towards the NGSS is overwhelmingly positive -- 33 times more so than for the CCSS. Mixed effects models indicated that sentiment became more positive over time and that teachers, in particular, showed a more positive sentiment towards the NGSS. We discuss implications for educational reform efforts and the use of data science methods for understanding their implementation.

**Data Source & Analysis**

Similar to what we'll be learning in this lab, Rosenberg et al. used publicly accessible data from Twitter collected using the Full-Archive Twitter API and the `rtweet` package in R. Specifically, the authors accessed tweets and user information from the hashtag-based \#NGSSchat online community, all tweets that included any of the following phrases, with "/" indicating an additional phrase featuring the respective plural form: "ngss", "next generation science standard/s", "next gen science standard/s".

Unlike this learning lab, however, the authors determined Tweet sentiment using the Java version of SentiStrength to assign tweets to two 5-point scales of sentiment, one for positivity and one for negativity, because SentiStrength is a validated measure for sentiment in short informal texts (Thelwall et al., 2011). In addition, they used this tool because Wang and Fikis (2019) used it to explore the sentiment of CCSS-related posts. We'll be using the AFINN sentiment lexicon which also assigns words in a tweet to two 5-point scales, in addition to exploring some other sentiment lexicons to see if they produce similar results.

The authors also used the `lme4` package in R to run a mixed effects model to determine if sentiment changes over time and differs between teachers and non-teacher. In addition to looking at the relationships between tweet sentiment, time and teachers, we'll also take a look at the correlation between words within tweets.

**Summary of Key Findings**

1.  Contrasting with sentiment about CSSS, sentiment about the NGSS science education reform effort is overwhelmingly positive, with approximately 9 positive tweets for every negative tweet.
2.  Teachers were more positive than non-teachers, and sentiment became substantially more positive over the ten years of NGSS-related posts.
3.  Differences between the context of the tweets were small, but those that did not include the \#NGSSchat hashtag became more positive over time than those posts that did not include the hashtag.
4.  Individuals posted more tweets during \#NGSSchat chats, the sentiment of their posts was more positive, suggesting that while the context of individual tweets has a small effect (with posts not including the hashtag becoming more positive over time), the effect upon individuals of being involved in the \#NGSSchat was positive.

Finally, you can watch Dr. Rosenberg provide a quick 3-minute overview of this work at [\<https://stanford.app.box.com/s/i5ixkj2b8dyy8q5j9o5ww4nafznb497x\>](https://stanford.app.box.com/s/i5ixkj2b8dyy8q5j9o5ww4nafznb497x){.uri}

### 1b. Define Questions

One overarching question that Silge and Robinson (2018) identify as a central question to text mining and natural language processing, and that we'll explore throughout the text mining labs this year, is the question:

> How do we to **quantify** what a document or collection of documents is about?

The questions guiding the Rosenberg et al. study attempt to quantify public sentiment around the NGSS and how that sentiment changes over time. Specifically, they asked:

1.  What is the public sentiment expressed toward the NGSS?
2.  How does sentiment for teachers differ from non-teachers?
3.  How do tweets posted to \#NGSSchat differ from those without the hashtag?
4.  How does participation in \#NGSSchat relate to the public sentiment individuals express?
5.  How does public sentiment vary over time?

For our first lab on text mining in STEM education, we'll use approaches similar to those used by the authors cited above to better understand public discourse surrounding these standards, particularly as they relate to STEM education. We will also try to guage public sentiment around the NGSS, by comparing how much more positive or negative NGSS tweets are relative to CSSS tweets. Specifically, in the next four learning lab we'll attempt to answer the following questions:

1.  What are the most frequent words or phrases used in reference to tweets about the CCSS and NGSS?
2.  What words and hashtags commonly occur together?
3.  How does sentiment for NGSS compare to sentiment for CCSS?

### 1c. Load Libraries

#### tidyverse 📦

![](img/tidyverse.png){width="20%"}

As noted in our Getting Started activity, R uses "packages" and add-ons that enhance its functionality. One package that we'll be using extensively is {tidyverse}. The {tidyverse} package is actually a [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed for reading, wrangling, and exploring data and which all share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. This shared features are sometimes "tidy data principles."

Click the green arrow in the right corner of the "code chunk" that follows to load the {tidyverse} library.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Again, don't worry if you saw a number of messages: those probably mean that the tidyverse loaded just fine. Any conflicts you may have seen mean that functions in these packages you loaded have the same name as functions in other packages and R will default to function from the last loaded package unless you specify otherwise.

#### tidytext 📦

![](img/tidytext.png){width="100"}

As we'll learn first hand in this module, using tidy data principles can also make many text mining tasks easier, more effective, and consistent with tools already in wide use. The {tidytext} package helps to convert text into data frames of individual words, making it easy to to manipulate, summarize, and visualize text using using familiar functions form the {tidyverse} collection of packages.

Let's go ahead and load the {tidytext} package:

```{r load-tidytext, message=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
```

For a more comprehensive introduction to the `tidytext` package, we cannot recommend enough the free online book, *Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach* [@silge2017text].

## 2. WRANGLE

In this section, we'll be working with data retrieved using the Twitter API

a.  **Merge Data**. First we revisit the familiar `read_csv()` function for reading in our CCSS and NGSS introduce two new functions for merging data frames as we've seen in earlier learning labs.
b.  **Restructure Data**.
c.  **Tidy Text.** We introduce the {tidytext} package to "tidy" and tokenize our tweets in order to create our data frame for analysis revisit the concept of joins to remove "stop words" that don't add much value to our analysis.

### 2a. Import and View Data

```{r}
ccss_tweets <- read.csv("data/ccss-tweets.csv")
```

```{r}
ngss_tweets <- read.csv("data/ngss-tweets.csv")
```

```{r}

ss_tweets <- union(ccss_tweets,
                   ngss_tweets)

```

### 2b. Restructure Data

#### Subset Tweets

As you may have noticed, we have way more data than we need for our analysis and should probably pare it down to just what we'll use.

First, it's likely the authors removed retweets from their analysis since a retweet is simply a user reposting someone else's tweet and would duplicate the exact same content of the original.

It's also likely that they limited their analysis to just English language tweets so let's filter for those as well.

Use the `filter()` function introduced in previous labs to subset rows containing only original tweets in the English language:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
ngss_tweets_r1 <- ngss_tweets_q4 %>% 
  filter(is_retweet == "FALSE", 
         lang == "en")
```

Now let's use the `select()` function to select the following columns from our new `ngss_teeets_en` data frame:

1.  `screen_name` of the user who created the tweet
2.  `created_at` timestamp for examining changes in sentiment over time
3.  `text` containing the tweet which is our primary data source of interest

```{r select-variables, eval=TRUE}
ngss_tweets_r2 <- select(ngss_tweets_r1,
                      screen_name, 
                      created_at, 
                      text)
```

#### Add & Reorder Columns

Finally, since we are interested in comparing the sentiment of NGSS tweets with CSSS tweets, it would be helpful if we had a column to quickly identify the set of state standards with which each tweet is associated.

We'll use the `mutate()` function to create a new variable called `standards` to label each tweets as "ngss":

```{r}
ngss_tweets_r3 <- mutate(ngss_tweets_r2, standards = "ngss")
```

And just because it bothers me, I'm going to use the `relocate()` function to move the `standards` column to the first position so I can quickly see which standards the tweet is from:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_r4 <- relocate(ngss_tweets_r3, standards)
```

Note that you could also have used the `select()` function to reorder columns like so:

```{r}
ngss_tweets_r5 <- select(ngss_tweets_r4, standards, screen_name, created_at, text)
```

Before moving on to the CCSS standards, let's rewrite the code from our wrangling so there is less redundancy and it is easier to read:

```{r}
# Search Tweets
ngss_dictionary <- c("#NGSSchat OR ngss",
                     '"next generation science standard"',
                     '"next generation science standards"',
                     '"next gen science standard"',
                     '"next gen science standards"')

ngss_tweets <- ngss_dictionary %>%
  search_tweets2(n = 5000,
                 include_rts = FALSE,
                 lang = "en") %>%
  select(text, screen_name, created_at) %>%
  mutate(standards = "ngss") %>%
  relocate(standards)

head(ngss_tweets)
```

**Note:** Rather than using `filter()` to remove retweets and non-English language tweets, we used the handy `include_rts = FALSE` and `lang = "en"` arguments included in the `search_tweets2()` function to simplify the code.

##### [Your Turn]{style="color: green;"} ⤵

Recall from section [1b. Define Questions] that we are interested in comparing word usage and public sentiment around both the Common Core and Next Gen Science Standards.

1.  Create an new `ccss_tweets` data frame consisting of Common Core tweets by modifying code above.

2.  Similar to Wang and Fikis (2019), use the \#CommonCore and \#CCSS hashtags as your search terms.

3.  Try using the handy `include_rts = FALSE` and `lang = "en"` arguments included in the `search_tweets2()` function to remove retweets and non-English language tweets.

You're output should look something like this:

```{r retweet-argument, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
ccss_tweets <- search_tweets(q = "#commoncore OR #ccss", 
                             n=5000, 
                             include_rts = FALSE,
                             lang = "en") %>%
  select(text, screen_name, created_at) %>%
  mutate(standards = "ccss") %>%
  relocate(standards)
  

datatable(ccss_tweets)
```

[**WARNING:**]{style="color: red;"} You will not be able to progress to the next section until you have completed the following task:

#### Merge Data Frames

Finally, let's combine our `ccss_text` and `ngss_text` into a single data frame by using the `bind_rows()` function from `dplyr` by simply supplying the data frames that you want to combine as arguments:

```{r}
ss_tweets <- bind_rows(ngss_tweets, ccss_tweets)
```

Note that when creating a "union" like this (i.e. stacking one data frame on top of another), you should have the same number of columns in each data frame and they should be in the exact same order.

And let's take a quick look at both the `head()` and the `tail()` of this new `tweets` data frame to make sure it contains both "ngss" and "ccss" standards:

```{r}
head(ss_tweets)
tail(ss_tweets)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2c. Tidy Text

Text data by it's very nature is ESPECIALLY untidy and is sometimes referred to as "unstructured" data. In this section we are introduced to the `tidytext` package and will learn some new functions to convert text to and from tidy formats. Having our text in a tidy format will allow us to switch seamlessly between tidy tools and existing text mining packages, while also making it easier to visualize text summaries in other data analysis tools like Tableau.

#### Tokenize Text {data-link="2b. Tidy Text"}

In [Chapter 1 of Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html), Silge and Robinson (2018) define the tidy text format as a table with one-token-per-row, and explain that:

> A **token** is a meaningful unit of text, such as a word, two-word phrase (bigram), or sentence that we are interested in using for analysis. And tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens.

This one-token-per-row structure is in contrast to the ways text is often stored for text analysis, perhaps as strings in a corpus object or in a document-term matrix. For tidy text mining, the token that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or paragraph.

For this part of our workflow, our goal is to transform our `ss_tweets` data from this:

```{r ccss-table, echo=FALSE}
ss_tweets
```

Into a "tidy text" one-token-per-row format that looks like this:

```{r tweet-tidy, echo=FALSE}
tidy_tweets <- ss_tweets %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, 
                input = text, 
                token = "tweets") %>% 
  relocate(standards, word)

```

```{r ccss-tibble, echo=FALSE}
tidy_tweets
```

In later labs we'll learn about other data structures for text analysis like the document-term matrix and corpus objects. For now, however, working with the familiar tidy data frame allows us to take advantage of popular packages that use the shared tidyverse syntax and principles for wrangling, exploring, and modeling data.

##### Unigrams

The `tidytext` package provides the incredibly powerful `unnest_tokens()` function to tokenize text (including tweets!) and convert them to a one-token-per-row format.

Let's tokenize our tweets by using this function to split each tweet into a single row to make it easier to analyze:

```{r unnest-tokens}
ss_tweets_u1 <- unnest_tokens(ss_tweets, 
                               output = word, 
                               input = text)

head(ss_tweets_u1)
```

There is A LOT to unpack with this function:

-   First notice that `unnest_tokens()` expects a data frame as the first argument, followed by two column names.
-   The second argument is an output column name that doesn't currently exist but will be created as the text is "unnested" into it (`word`, in this case).
-   This is followed by the input column that the text comes from, which we uncreatively named `text`.
-   By default, a token is an individual word or unigram.
-   Other columns, such as `screen_name` and `created_at`, are retained.
-   All punctuation has been removed.
-   Tokens have been changed to lowercase, which makes them easier to compare or combine with other datasets (use the `to_lower = FALSE` argument to turn off if desired).

#### [Your Turn]{style="color: green;"} ⤵ {style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"}

The `unnest_tokens()` function also has specialized `“tweets”` tokenizer in the `tokens =` argument that is very useful for dealing with Twitter text in that it retains hashtags and mentions of usernames with the \@ symbol.

Rewrite the code below to include the token argument set to "tweets":

```{r token-tweet, eval=FALSE}
ss_tweets_u2 <- unnest_tokens(ss_tweets, 
                              output = word, 
                              input = text, 
                              _____ = _____)
```

Your output should look something like this:

```{r ccss-unigram, echo=FALSE}
ss_tweets_u2 <- unnest_tokens(ss_tweets, 
                             output = word, 
                             input = text, 
                             token = "tweets")

head(ss_tweets_u2)
```

##### Bigrams

In the function above we specified tokens as individual words, but many interesting text analyses are based on the relationships between words, which words tend to follow others immediately, or words that tend to co-occur within the same documents.

We can also use the `unnest_tokens()` function to tokenize our tweets into consecutive sequences of words, called **n-grams**. By seeing how often word X is followed by word Y, we can then build a model of the relationships between them as well see in Part 2.

We do this by adding the `token = "ngrams"` option to [`unnest_tokens()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/tidytext/man/unnest_tokens.html), and setting `n` to the number of words in each n-gram. Let's set `n` to 2, so we can examine pairs of two consecutive words, often called "bigrams":

```{r ccss-bigrams}
ss_tweets_b1 <- ss_tweets %>% 
  unnest_tokens(bigram, 
                text, 
                token = "ngrams", 
                n = 2)

head(ss_tweets_b1)
```

Before we move any further let's take a quick look at the most common unigrams and bigrams in our two datasets:

```{r}
ss_tweets_u2 %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

ss_tweets_b1 %>% 
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

Well, many of these tweets are clearly about the ccss and ngss, but beyond that it's a bit hard to tell because there are so many "stop words" like "the", "to", "and", "in" that don't carry much meaning by themselves.

#### Remove Stop Words

Often in text analysis, we will want to remove these stop words if they are not useful for an analysis. The `stop_words` dataset in the tidytext package contains stop words from three lexicons. We can use them all together, as we have here, or `filter()` to only use one set of stop words if that is more appropriate for a certain analysis.

Let's take a closer the lexicons and stop words included in each:

```{r}
datatable(stop_words)
```

#### The `anti_join` Function

In order to remove these stop words, we will use a function called `anti_join()` that looks for matching values in a specific column from two datasets and returns rows from the original dataset that have no matches like so:

![](img/anti-join.png)

For a good overview of the different `dplyr` joins see here: <https://medium.com/the-codehub/beginners-guide-to-using-joins-in-r-682fc9b1f119>

Now let's remove stop words that don't help us learn much about what people are saying about the state standards.

```{r stop-unigrams}
ss_tweets_u3 <- anti_join(ss_tweets_u2,
                           stop_words,
                           by = "word")

head(ss_tweets_u3)
```

Notice that we've specified the `by =` argument to look for matching words in the `word` column for both data sets and remove any rows from the `tweet_tokens` dataset that match the `stop_words` dataset. Remember when we first tokenized our dataset I conveniently chose `output = word` as the column name because it matches the column name `word` in the `stop_words` dataset contained in the `tidytext` package. This makes our call to `anti_join()`simpler because `anti_join()` knows to look for the column named `word` in each dataset. However this wasn't really necessary since `word` is the only matching column name in both datasets and it would have matched those columns by default.

#### Filtering Bigrams

As we saw above, a lot of the most common bigrams are pairs of common (uninteresting) words as well. Dealing with these is a little less straightforward and we'll need to use the `separate()` function from the `tidyr` package, which splits a column into multiple based on a delimiter. This lets us separate it into two columns, "word1" and "word2", at which point we can remove cases where either is a stop-word.

```{r stop-bigrams}
library(tidyr)

ss_tweets_b2 <- ss_tweets_b1 %>%
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")

ss_tweets_b3 <- ss_tweets_b2 %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

ss_tweets_b4 <- ss_tweets_b3 %>%
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")
```

\

#### Custom Stop Words

Before wrapping up, let's take a quick count of the most common unigrams and bigrams to see if the results are a little more meaningful:

```{r}
ss_tweets_u3 %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

ss_tweets_b4 %>% 
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```

Notice that the nonsense word "amp" is among our high frequency words. Let's add a filter to our previous code similar to what we did with our bigrams to remove rows with "amp" in them:

```{r}
ss_tweets_u4 <-
  ss_tweets_u3 %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  filter(!word == "amp")
```

Note that we could extend this filter to weed out any additional words that don't carry much meaning but skew our data by being so prominent.

#### [Your Turn]{style="color: green;"} ⤵ {style="font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3); -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration: none; caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"}

Tidy your `my_tweets` dataset from Section 2a by tokenizing your text into unigrams and removing stop words.

Also, since we created some unnecessarily lengthy code to demonstrate many of the steps in the tidying process, try to use a more compact series of functions and assign your data frame to `my_tidy_tweets`.
