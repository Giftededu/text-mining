# Text Mining in STEM Ed Research

The transition to digital learning has made available new sources of data, providing researchers new opportunities for understanding and improving STEM learning. Data sources such as digital learning environments and administrative data systems, as well as data produced by social media websites and the mass digitization of academic and practitioner publications, hold enormous potential to address a range of pressing problems in STEM Education, but collecting and analyzing text-based data also presents unique challenges.

**Text Mining (TM) Module 1: Public Sentiment and the State Standards** will help demonstrate how text mining can be applied in STEM education research and provide LASER Institute scholars hands-on experience with popular techniques for collecting, processing, and analyzing text-based data. Specifically, the four learning labs that make up this module address the following topics:

-   **Learning Lab 1: Tidy Text, Tokens, & Twitter.** We take a closer look at the literature guiding our analysis; wrangle our data into a one-token-per-row tidy text format; and use simple word counts to explore our tweets about the common core and next generation science standards.

-   **Learning Lab 2: Come to the Dark Side.** We focus on the use of lexicons in our third lab and introduce the {vader} package to compare the sentiment of tweets about the NGSS and CCSS state standards in order to better understand public reaction to these two curriculum reform efforts. 

-   **Learning Lab 3: A Tale of Two Standards.** We wrap our look at public sentiment around STEM state curriculum standards by selecting an analysis that provides some unique insight; refining and polishing a data product; and writing a brief narrative to communicate findings in response to our research questions.

-   **Learning Lab 4: Bigrams + Word Pairs = 4x the Fun.** For our last lab, we'll see what insights bigrams, word pairs and word correlations tell us about our tweets and what they might suggest about public sentiment towards the CCSS and NGSS.
