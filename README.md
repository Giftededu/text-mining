# Text Mining in STEM Ed Research

The transition to digital learning has made available new sources of data, providing researchers new opportunities for understanding and improving STEM learning. Data sources such as digital learning environments and administrative data systems, as well as data produced by social media websites and the mass digitization of academic and practitioner publications, hold enormous potential to address a range of pressing problems in STEM Education, but collecting and analyzing text-based data also presents unique challenges.

**Lab 1: Text Mining Basics - Tidy Text & Word Counts** as summarized in our [Overview Presentation] is a gentle introduction to getting our text “tidy” so we can perform some basic word counts, look at words that occur at a higher rate in a group of documents, examine words that are unique to those document groups, and create visualizations such as word cloud. The focus of our [Essential Readings] and case study in this lab is to help LASER Scholars gain a general understanding of key text mining concepts and terminology, as well as develop a basic comfort level with quantifying text data and working with text data. Our [Text mining Case Study: What aspects of online professional development offerings do teachers find most valuable?] is guided by the work from [Friday Institute] and it examined teachers' experiences in professional development. Finally, the [Intro to Text Mining Badge] provides an opportunity create your own data product and to reflect on how theses concepts and techniques might apply to your own research.

**Lab 2: Dictionary-Methods - Twitter Sentiment and School Reform** as summarized in our [Overview Presentation] moves beyond basic concepts of text mining and takes a closer look at a dictionary-based text mining technique, sentiment analysis. Our [Essential Readings] examine the topic of opinion mining or sentiment analysis. This technique is very helpful for us to understand people's opinions about things such as a policy. Our [Text mining Case Study: Do the public like NGSS?] investigates the public sentiment expressed toward the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and compares the sentiment for NGSS and Common Core State Standards using twitter data. This study is from [Josh's team] (https://osf.io/xymsd/). Finally, the [Sentiment Analysis Badge] provides an opportunity create your own data product and to reflect on how theses concepts and techniques might apply to your own research.

**Topic Modeling in MOOC-Eds** as summarized in our [Overview Presentation] focuses on identifying “topics” by examining how words cohere into different latent, or hidden, themes based on patterns of co-occurrence of words within documents. Our [Essential Readings] introduces this unsupervised machine learning technique. Our [Text mining Case Study: What are participants discussing in forums?] is guided by the work from [Friday Institute] and it explores ideas or issues emerged in the discussion forums in a MOOC-ed course. You can learn more about the work [here] ([https://www.hashtagcommoncore.com/](https://www.learntechlib.org/p/195234/)). Finally, the [Groups & Egos Badge](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-3/sna-lab-3-badge.html) provides an opportunity create your own data product and to reflect on how theses concepts and techniques might apply to your own research.

**SNA Learning Lab 4: Statistical Inference & Network Models** as summarized in our [Overview Presentation](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-4/sna-lab-4-slides.html#1) wraps up our work with SNA and examines recent advances in inferential statistics that can be used to make predictions from social network data and test hypotheses we have about a network of interest. Through our [essential readings](https://github.com/laser-institute/essential-readings/tree/main/sna-labs/sna-lab-4), we'll learn about different techniques that make use of simulations to model network data and how these statistical models are used to address questions that more completely reflect the complexity of educational settings. For example, our [SNA Case Study: Birds of a Feather Lead Together](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-4/sna-lab-4-case-key.html) is inspired by the work of [Daly and Finnigan (2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0002831210368990) makes use of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to examine social processes (e.g. reciprocity and homophily) that might explain how school and district-level leaders select peers for collaboration or confidential exchanges. Finally, the [Models & Inference Badge](https://laser-institute.github.io/network-analysis/lab-4/sna-lab-4-badge.html) provides an opportunity create your own data product and to reflect on how theses concepts and techniques might apply to your own research.
